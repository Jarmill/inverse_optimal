%why is the distance generated by sdp_cons for the test3 example higher
%than the same problem worked out in local search?
%
%that makes no sense. the sdp should be a lower bound.
%
%very likely there are extra constraints added in the sdp

%% load data
load('test3_data.mat');
load('test3_derived.mat');

%% local search solution
%using yalmip in order to get the dual variables
[func_bound, selector, vars] = cons_local_yalmip_model(y, Q, phi, Asdp, bsdp, Aeqsdp, beqsdp);

opts = sdpsettings('solver', 'mosek');
sol = optimize(func_bound.cons, func_bound.obj, opts);
